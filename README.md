This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Requirements

## Mandatory

- [x] Handles 100, 000s of rows (Columns)
- [] Generic, reusable API that abstracts away the underlying implementation (I don't understand this)
- [x] Light backend that serves up the data `src/components/Dashboard/services`
- [x] Allow sorting by clicking on columns

## Optional stretch goals

- [x] Auto-sizes columns based on cell content
- [x] Resizable (YES) / draggable columns (NO)
- [x] Edit cell content (But can't save to DOM as no crud operation set)
- [x] Ability to delete rows
- [x] Tests
